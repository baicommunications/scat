# Small Derivation of Original SCAT Library 

Original Repository didn't contain the logic to write to wireshark format with an input dump file.
This repository contians changes to allow for us to write from qmdl input file to pcap output file. 

**to avoid dependency issues its best to create a venv for this** 

To install the required dependices run **(you can skip the first two steps if you already have python and pip installed on your system)**: 

``` curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py ```<br>
``` git clone https://github.com/baicommunications/scat.git ```<br>
``` cd scat ```<br>
``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

To run the program ↓


```python ./scat.py -t qc -d log.qmdl -F log.pcap```

or

```python3 ./scat.py -t qc -d log.qmdl -F log.pcap```

These Instructions were derived from this [blog post](https://blog.cacombos.com/2021/06/13/convert-qmdl-to-pcap/)<br><br>

# SCAT: Signaling Collection and Analysis Tool

This application parses diagnostic messages of Qualcomm and Samsung baseband
through USB, and generates a stream of GSMTAP packet containing cellular control
plane messages.

## Requirements

### On PC

Only tested in Linux, mostly various versions of Ubuntu. Python 3 is a minimum
requirement, and the following external modules are required:

* [pyUSB](https://pypi.org/project/pyusb/)
* [pySerial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/)

To properly decode GSMTAP packets generated by SCAT, Wireshark 2.6.0 or above is
required. For older Wireshark releases, we are providing a Wireshark Lua plugin
to extend the GSMTAP dissector. GSMTAP definition used by SCAT is based on
libosmocore 0.11.0.

### Smartphones

Cellular device must expost the diagnostic port via USB. This is largely
device-dependent and we can not give generic solution for all devices. Search
the Internet with keyword `(your device name) qpst` to get the method of
exposing the diagnostic port for Qualcomm-based smartphones.

* Samsung: Enter `*#0808#` in dialer, select any USB mode entry containing `DM`.
  * Korean models: Enter `3197123580` in dialer, password is either `996412`,
    `776432`, `0821`.
  * Certain version of firmwares after 2018 are blocking the access to the
    hidden menu with the abovementioned code. Currently no solution is known
    without rooting the phone (correction wanted).
* LG: Enter `277634#*#` in dialer (TODO: exact location of USB test menu)
  * On some LG devices, diagnostic ports are not exposed in Linux even after
    enabling the USB testing mode. This is due to multiple USB device
    configuration used; udev rules changing the current USB configuration is
    recommended in such devices.
* Sony: Rooting required. Get a rooted adb shell and enter the command `setprop
  persist.usb.eng 1`.
* Nexus: Rooting required. Get a rooted adb shell and enter the command
  `setprop sys.usb.config diag,adb`.
  * Not working for Pixel devices!
* Sailfish OS: (TODO: how to modify usb-moded settings)

## Usage

While we recommend using USB directly to access the diagnostics port, if your
smartphone's diagnostic port is accessible via serial port, using it is also
possible. The `qcserial` kernel module do not have the information of diagnostic
port of all Qualcomm-based smartphones, and no such module exist for
Samsung-based smartphones.

Accessing the baseband diagnostics via USB:

`$ scat.py -t qc -u -a 001:010 -i 2`

The first `-t qc` defines that we are parsing a Qualcomm baseband. For Samsung
baseband, use `sec` instead of `qc` and you need to supply the model manually
like this example:

`$ scat.py -t sec -m e333 -u -a 001:006 -i 2`

Available model types are following:

* `-m cmc221s`: CMC221S, used in very early Samsung LTE modem/smartphone.
* `-m e303`: Exynos modem 303.
* `-m e333`: Exynos modem 333.
* Newer Exynos modems might work with `-m e333` option, YMMV.

`-u` specifies that we are accessing the diagnostic device via USB. 

Although there are small heuristic to determine the connected device, it is
recommended to explicitly specify the USB device address and interface number of
diagnostics node. `-a 001:010` specifies the address, which follows the same
syntax visible in `lsusb` command. `-i 2` specifies the interface number of the
diagnostic node, which is again device specific.

Accessing the baseband diagnostics via serial port:

`$ scat.py -t qc -s /dev/ttyUSB0`

Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` to what is your diagnostic device.

By default, SCAT will send packets to 127.0.0.1, control plane packets to UDP
port 4729 as GSMTAP, user plane packets to UDP port 47290 as IP.

Exit the application with Ctrl+C.

### Advanced Options

Destination to send the GSMTAP packet could be changed using `-H 127.0.0.2`
switch. For example, this command will send all packets to 127.0.0.2:

`$ scat.py -t sec -m e333 -u -a 001:006 -i 2 -H 127.0.0.2`

You may want to use the following command to be able to easily sort it with
Wireshark:

```
ifconfig ethUSB 127.0.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
sudo route add -net 127.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 127.0.0.1
```

It is possible to automatically determine the USB bus address by using other
command's outputs.  Following example is for Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini: 

```
    val=$(lsusb | awk '/Samsung/ {print substr($4, 1, length($4)-1)}')
    sudo ./scat.py -t sec -m e303 -u -a 001:$val -i 4 -H 127.0.0.2
```

### Tested Devices

Please see the [wiki page](https://github.com/fgsect/scat/wiki/Devices).

## Known Bugs

Issues related to exposing the diagnostics port via USB is out of scope.

* On certain Qualcomm devices, after exiting and launching the application for
  more than once, initialization eventually hangs and no messages are appearing.
  Root cause still in investigation. Solution: reboot the smartphone.
* On certain Samsung devices, metadata information like EARFCN is missing or
  control plane messages are not appearing. We are aware of issues and please
  notify us about your environment to fix this.
